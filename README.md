## Overview
What in the world?!
With such a vast world out there, don't we all have a little more to learn?
What in the World is an application designed to help users of all ages learn more about different countries in the world! 
It is an interactive application that allows users to the world's countries explore from anywhere. 
When loading the page, a user is able to view a world map and select which country they would like to learn about. 
They are taken to a randomized question and asked to input and submit a guess. 
They are then taken to a view that lists if their answer is correct or incorrect and some other fun facts about that particular country.
They're able to return to the home page by clicking the What in the World text and select another country to continue learning!
